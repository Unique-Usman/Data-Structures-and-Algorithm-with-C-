2. Thermal comfort analysis of personalized conditioning system and performance assessment with different radiant cooling systems - 2023
The radiant systems consume less energy and provide better thermal comfort as compared to the conventional system, but the main drawback of radiant technology is inability to cater the latent load and condensation. This problem has engaged researchers to push their emphasis on Personalized Conditioning System (PCS). It forms a micro-climate region near the occupant. This study is aimed at PCS combined with a radiant conditioning system, which evaluates the performance of the PCS and compares it with different radiant cooling systems. A radiant cubicle was used to investigate the performance of the PCS for both heating & cooling modes. For heating mode, the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) was calculated with the help of thermal comfort surveys which were in a range of 23.4°C to 27.3°C. For cooling mode, four different cases compared the performance of the system which are: Conventional Air …

4. Interface design for residential energy feedback, in the Indian context - 2023
Global access to electricity has increased from 78.2% to 2000 to 90.5% in 2020, resulting in an increased electricity demand worldwide. Unlike commercial electricity consumption, which is managed by professionals, residential consumption is managed by the householders, who often lack insight into their energy usage. Quality feedback, including detailed energy consumption and tips, can lead to substantial household savings. There are several mediums for providing energy feedback, such as Short Message Service (SMS), postal letter, email, mobile app, and In-Home Display (IHD). Studies suggest that feedback through electronic media can save up to 20% of energy consumption. In this work, we aim to design mobile application interfaces that can maximize energy savings through effective feedback. The level of savings realized is dependent on the user’s preferences and understanding of the information presented. User preferences are subjective of their profile (e.g., age, occupation, income) and the cultural context (e.g., country). The possibility of energy reduction is high when the provided information matches the user preferred information for feedback. Smart homes have recently been included as an annexure in India’s building energy code (Eco Niwas Samhita 2021), indicating a growing demand for quality energy feedback in India. However, there is a lack of research that addresses what feedback information is suitable for Indian users. We conducted two questionnaire-based surveys, one to understand users’ preferences for feedback information and another to validate the designed mobile application interface screens. The …

5. Identifying building archetypes based on energy performance as the major criteria: a case of Jaipur, India - 2023

7. Impact of Urban Heat Island formation on electricity consumption over Delhi region - 
Urban heat island (UHI) effect is a common phenomenon found in urban areas which is associated with the increased ambient temperature resulting from man-made alteration of the land. Urban structures with complex geometry, increased concretized surfaces and reduced natural land cover cause reduction in the rate of heat loss leading to increased temperature over urban areas and creating urban heat island (UHI). This study explores the temporal and spatial pattern of urban heat island (UHI) formation over Delhi. It is observed that the night-time surface temperature of central Delhi is higher in all months as compared to its surrounding rural areas. Thus, a nocturnal heat island forms over Delhi in all the seasons. The dense built-up area and impervious surfaces of Delhi are responsible for trapping heat which causes discomfort to humans, resulting in increased use of cooling devices with higher electricity consumption. Polynomial regression model based calculations show cooling load may be reduced up to 21-23% in summer months, 10 to 14% in monsoon season, and 8 to 17% in post-monsoon season if urban heat island effect is removed.

To maintain indoor air quality, there is a need to provide fresh air supply to mechanically conditioned spaces. In tropical climates, supply of fresh air at high temperature increases cooling energy consumption. To reduce the wastage of energy, energy recovery from exhaust air is useful. Energy Recovery Wheel (ERW) can be used to recover both sensible and latent heat from exhaust air at room temperature. If there is a fault in ERW system, it may cause a significant increase in energy consumption compared to the recovered energy. In large commercial buildings with various HVAC equipment installed, faults can remain undetected for hours to months depending on the nature of the fault, results in poor indoor air quality and wastage of energy. In this paper, a method is developed for automating Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of ERW units. The paper describes the implementation of SVM algorithm on the measured data.

14. Adaptive thermal comfort model based on field studies in five climate zones across India - 2022
Indian residences are vulnerable to heat-driven discomfort amid the mounting prevalence of weather extremes, residential design and construction practices, and densifying urbanscapes. Therefore, it is vital to understand the thermal comfort characteristics of nationwide residences. This study proposes an adaptive thermal comfort model based on yearlong field surveys in eight cities located across five climate zones of India – the India Model for Adaptive Comfort - Residential (IMAC-R). The model prescribes the operative temperature bands for 80% and 90% thermal acceptability in correlation with the outdoor reference temperature, applicable to mixed-mode (MM) and naturally ventilated (NV) residences.

This research aims to develop a methodology for assessing the energy-saving potential of semi-transparent photovoltaic (STPV) window, which has a complex relationship with daylighting and air conditioning (AC) electricity consumption. A case study has been developed for the composite climate of Hyderabad, India. The study examines four commercially available single and double pane STPV windows and similar non-photovoltaic windows. For evaluation, an automated parametric simulation tool was developed to compute the net electricity consumption (NEC) for a representative model building with different window systems, and several window-to-wall ratios (WWR) and orientations. The result shows benefit in adopting the STPV window system across all directions …

16. Impact of COVID-19 on energy consumption in a residential complex in Hyderabad, India - 2022
When the Indian government declared the first lockdown on 25 March 2020 to control the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, people were forced to stay and work from home. The aim of this study is to quantify the impact of stay-at-home orders on residential Air Conditioning (AC) energy and household electricity consumption (excluding AC energy). This was done using monitored data from 380 homes in a group of five buildings in Hyderabad, India. We gathered AC energy and household electricity consumption data at a 30-min interval for each home individually in April 2019 and April 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done on this data. To offset the difference in temperatures for the month of April in 2019 and 2020, only those weekdays were selected where the average temperature in 2019 was same as the average temperature in 2020. The study establishes that the average number of hours the AC was used per day in each home increased in the range 4.90–7.45% depending on the temperature for the year 2020. Correspondingly, the overall AC consumption increased in the range 3.60–4.5%, however the daytime (8:00 AM to 8:00 PM) AC energy consumption increased in the range 22–26% and nighttime (8:00 PM to 8:00 AM) AC energy consumption decreased by 5–7% in the year 2020. The study showed a rise in household electricity consumption of about 15% for the entire day in the year 2020. The household electricity consumption increased during daytime by 22- 27.50% and 1.90- 6.6% during the nighttime. It was observed that the morning household electricity peak demand shifted from 7:00 AM in 2019 to …

17. Investigation on air conditioning load patterns and electricity consumption of typical residential buildings in tropical wet and dry climate in India - 2022
The residential sector accounts for around 24% of the total electricity consumption in India. Recent studies show that air conditioners (ACs) have become a significant contributor to residential electricity consumption. Further, it is predicted that by 2037, the demand for ACs will increase by four times due to their affordability and availability. Not many studies have been found on residential AC usage patterns and the factors (AC load, setpoint, hours of usage) that influence household electricity consumption. This paper investigates the residential AC usage patterns and AC’s contribution to total residential electricity consumption. Twenty-five urban homes from a wet and dry climatic region of India were monitored for nine months (in 2019) to determine overall household electricity consumption patterns, AC usage, and indoor environment during summer, monsoon, and winter. Analysis of seasonal consumption patterns shows a significant difference in electricity usage between homes with ACs and homes without ACs during the summer season. The average electricity consumption for AC homes was 15.1 kWh/day during summer, 6.6 kWh/day during monsoon, and 6.1 kWh/day during the winter season. Results showed that AC alone contributed to 39% of the total household consumption in summers. The peak AC usage in all homes is observed during sleep hours which was generally between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am and the average AC runtime was 6.2 h. The average indoor temperature was recorded as 26.9 °C during the AC ON period. The AC peak load, i.e., the maximum electricity demand during the AC ON period, is 1.7 kW on average during …

18. SGLSim: tool for smart glazing energy performance analysis - 2022
A tool Smart Glazing Simulator (SGLSim), has been developed to perform parametric simulation analysis of different window systems with several window-to-wall ratios and orientations to compute and compare the annual energy performance. The net annual energy performance of the building is based on the electricity consumption in heating, cooling, interior lighting, and appliances, along with the electricity generation by the photovoltaic (PV) glazing, which is used to evaluate the energy performance of smart glazing. Performing parametric energy simulations and calculating the net annual electricity consumption of different combinations requires building modeling and energy simulation expertise. A web-based parametric tool can assist the user in carrying out the desired studies without requiring extensive technical knowledge. A case study is prepared for India’s warm and humid climatic zone. This study examines the benefits of double pane semi-transparent photovoltaics (STPV) glazing, STPV glazing with dynamic internal blind, and electrochromic (EC) glazing over other traditional glazing systems. The study shows that the optimal net annual electricity consumption in the case of STPV windows is 10–12% less than the optimal value obtained in a simple glazing case. Additionally, the result suggested that glare-controlled interior blinds in the STPV window further reduce the net annual electricity consumption by up to 15% compared to conventional glazing. Similarly, installing the EC glazing reduces the yearly electricity consumption by up to 5% compared to standard glazing.

19. Residential electricity current and appliance dataset for AC-event detection from Indian dwellings - 2022
Air Conditioners (ACs) have become a major contributor to residential electricity consumption in India. Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) can be used to understand residential AC use and its contribution to electricity consumption. NILM techniques use ground truth information along with meter readings to train disaggregation algorithms. There are datasets available for disaggregation, but no dataset is available for a hot tropical country like India especially for AC event detection. Our dataset’s primary objective is to help train NILM algorithms for AC event detection and compressor operations. The dataset comprises of home-level electrical current consumption and manually tagged AC ground truth (ON/OFF status) data at 1-min interval, indoor environment temperature and relative humidity readings at 5-min interval and dwelling, AC and household characteristics. The data was collected from 11 homes located in a composite climate zone-Hyderabad, India for 19 summer days (May) 2019. The dataset consists of 1.6 million data points and 450 AC cycles with each cycle having a runtime of more than 60 min (> 2000 compressor ON/OF cycles). Public availability of such a dataset will allow researchers to develop, train and test NILM algorithms that recognize AC and identify compressor operations.

20. Impact of urban heat island formation on energy consumption in Delhi - 2021
Reducing electricity consumption has emerged as a key area of concern according to the National Mission of Sustainable Habitat of Government of India. Among the Indian cities, Delhi's electricity consumption is the highest. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of UHI on electricity consumption of Delhi. The study utilizes the satellite land surface temperature (LST) data to compute the district-wise urban heat island intensity (UHII) in Delhi. The electricity consumption and LST data are used to examine the association between them. The scatter plots between per-capita net electricity consumption and night-time LST of each district show strong association between them and polynomial curves best fit this association. The equations of these polynomial curves are then used to estimate the electricity consumption of each district assuming their LSTs to be equal to that of the surrounding rural strip (i.e. without UHI effect …

21. A Deep Learning Technique using Low Sampling rate for residential Non Intrusive Load Monitoring - 2021
Individual device loads and energy consumption feedback is one of the important approaches for pursuing users to save energy in residences. This can help in identifying faulty devices and wasted energy by devices when left On unused. The main challenge is to identity and estimate the energy consumption of individual devices without intrusive sensors on each device. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, is a blind source separation problem which requires a system to estimate the electricity usage of individual appliances from the aggregated household energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for performing load disaggregation on low frequency power data obtained from residential households. We combine a series of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory (1D CNN-LSTM) to extract features that can identify active appliances and retrieve their power consumption given the aggregated household power value. We used CNNs to extract features from main readings in a given time frame and then used those features to classify if a given appliance is active at that time period or not. Following that, the extracted features are used to model a generation problem using LSTM. We train the LSTM to generate the disaggregated energy consumption of a particular appliance. Our neural network is capable of generating detailed feedback of demand-side, providing vital insights to the end-user about their electricity consumption. The algorithm was designed for low power offline devices such as ESP32. Empirical calculations show that …

22. Investigating the relationship between residential AC, indoor temperature and relative humidity in Indian dwellings - 2021
Residential electricity consumption (REC) in India has tripled in the past two decades accounting for 24% of the overall electricity consumption during 2018-19. Residential air conditioning (AC) usage is responsible for about 20%-40% of REC in India. This paper investigates the relationship of residential AC use with indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) using concurrent time-series monitoring data gathered in eight dwellings during summer and monsoon seasons. Contextual data about the dwelling (physical) and household characteristics were gathered using face-to-face interview based surveys. The dwellings were located in Hyderabad representing the composite climate of India. The mean daily electricity consumption was found to be higher in summer (11.5 kWh) possibly due to the higher usage of AC (because of higher ambient conditions) as compared to 6.5 kWh/day during monsoon season …

23. Robust short-term electrical load forecasting framework for commercial buildings using deep recurrent neural networks - 2020
This paper presents a robust short-term electrical load forecasting framework that can capture variations in building operation, regardless of building type and location. Nine different hybrids of recurrent neural networks and clustering are explored. The test cases involve five commercial buildings of five different building types, i.e., academic, research laboratory, office, school and grocery store, located at five different locations in Bangkok-Thailand, Hyderabad-India, Virginia-USA, New York-USA, and Massachusetts-USA. Load forecasting results indicate that the deep learning algorithms implemented in this paper deliver 20–45% improvement in load forecasting performance as compared to the current state-of-the-art results for both hour-ahead and 24-ahead load forecasting. With respect to sensitivity analysis, it is found that: (i) the use of hybrid deep learning algorithms can take as less as one month of data to …

24. Evaluating assumptions of scales for subjective assessment of thermal environments–Do laypersons perceive them the way, we researchers believe? - 2020
People's subjective response to any thermal environment is commonly investigated by using rating scales describing the degree of thermal sensation, comfort, and acceptability. Subsequent analyses of results collected in this way rely on the assumption that specific distances between verbal anchors placed on the scale exist and that relationships between verbal anchors from different dimensions that are assessed (e.g. thermal sensation and comfort) do not change. Another inherent assumption is that such scales are independent of the context in which they are used (climate zone, season, etc.). Despite their use worldwide, there is indication that contextual differences influence the way the scales are perceived and therefore question the reliability of the scales’ interpretation. To address this issue, a large international collaborative questionnaire study was conducted in 26 countries, using 21 different languages …

25. Review of studies on thermal comfort in Indian residential buildings - 2020
This article presents a systematic review of thermal comfort studies in Indian residential buildings, to identify the present research scenario, data gaps, and policy interventions. The majority of the studies were performed in a composite climate (10), followed by a warm humid climate (seven), and a very few from cold (two) and hot and dry (two) climates. None of these thermal comfort studies took place in a temperate climate. In addition, seven studies have considered multiple climates for assessment of thermal comfort in residential buildings. This illustrates that thermal comfort studies in Indian residential buildings are scarce, scattered, and unorganized. Further, due to differences in sociocultural setup and local adaptations, wide variations in occupant comfort requirements were reported. This review argues that there are dynamic modifications in individual behaviors due to changes in cost of building energy …

26. Effect of Surface Temperature on Energy Consumption in a Calibrated Building: A Case Study of Delhi - 2020
Rapid urbanization and associated land-use changes in cities cause an increase in the demand for electricity by altering the local climate. The present study aims to examine the variations in total energy and cooling energy demand in a calibrated building energy model, caused by urban heat island formation over Delhi. The study used Sentinel-2A multispectral imagery for land use and land cover (LULC) of mapping of Delhi, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for land surface temperature (LST) mapping during March 2018. It was observed that regions with dense built-up areas (i.e., with built-up area greater than 90%) had a higher annual land surface temperature (LST), i.e., 293.5 K and urban heat island intensity (UHII) ranging from 0.9 K–5.9 K. In contrast, lower annual values of LST (290K) and UHII (0.0–0.4 K) were observed in regions with high vegetation cover (53%). Statistical analysis reveals that a negative correlation exists between vegetation and nighttime LST, which is further confirmed by linear regression analysis. Energy simulations were performed on a calibrated building model placed at three different sites, identified on the basis of land use and land cover percentage and annual LST. Simulation results showed that the site located in the central part of Delhi displayed higher annual energy consumption (255.21 MWh/y) compared to the site located in the rural periphery (235.69 MWh/y). For all the three sites, the maximum electricity consumption was observed in the summer season, while the minimum was seen in the winter season. The study indicates that UHI formation leads to increased …

27. Evaluation of thermally activated furniture on thermal comfort and energy consumption: An experimental study - 2020
Personalized Comfort Systems (PCS) have been seen as an effective alternative to provide thermal comfort along with reducing energy consumption. This paper contains the methodology and results of a study conducted in a laboratory environment that aims to evaluate Thermally Activated Furniture (TAF) panels. These panels mounted in front and on the side of a workstation as space partition panels, can provide thermal comfort and have the potential to save energy. The experiments were carried out in a controlled thermal comfort chamber using a thermal mannequin having 22 body segments and TAF.

This paper undertakes a meta-study of residential energy studies in India to characterise their scope, data collection methods and findings. An in-depth review of literature was undertaken using Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect to identify relevant journal publications, conference papers and reports. A series of expert workshops were held to identify any data gaps and stakeholders' needs. The identified studies were characterised using a meta-data framework that included criteria such as climate, dwelling form, income group, methods and study duration. An online searchable platform (REACT) was created to make the identified studies more accessible using the meta-data criteria. Of the 29 studies identified, only 16 were …

29. A feature fusion technique for improved non-intrusive load monitoring - 2020
Load identification is an essential step in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), a process of estimating the power consumption of individual appliances using only whole-house aggregate consumption. Such estimates can help consumers and utility companies improve load management and save power. Current state-of-the-art methods for load identification generally use either steady state or transient features for load identification. We hypothesize that these are complementary features and so a hybrid combination of them will result in an improved appliance signature. We propose a novel hybrid combination that has the advantage of being low-dimensional and can thus be easily integrated with existing classification models to improve load identification. Our improved hybrid features are then used for building appliance identification models using Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. The proposed NILM methodology is evaluated for robustness in changing environments. An automated data collection setup is established to capture 7 home appliances aggregate data under varying voltages. Experimental results show that our proposed feature fusion based algorithms are more robust and outperform steady state and transient feature-based algorithms by at least +9% and +15% respectively.

33. A review of advances for thermal and visual comfort controls in personal environmental control (PEC) systems - 2019
The buildings are conventionally operated to maintain homogeneous indoor ambient conditions to maintain comfortable thermal and visual environments. However, maintaining these homogeneous conditions throughout the building leads to unnecessary energy consumption, and does not address the varying thermal and visual comfort needs of the individual occupants. This has led the building science community to pursue personal environmental control (PEC) systems that work in tandem with adaptive centralized ambient comfort systems. These PEC systems create favorable environmental conditions around each occupant, employing specialized equipment, such as a personal thermal conditioning system, task lighting, plug load monitoring and control, window shade control system, and similar systems. Coordinating among personal control systems and with centralized building management systems allows …

35. The Scales Project, a cross-national dataset on the interpretation of thermal perception scales - 2019
Thermal discomfort is one of the main triggers for occupants’ interactions with components of the built environment such as adjustments of thermostats and/or opening windows and strongly related to the energy use in buildings. Understanding causes for thermal (dis-)comfort is crucial for design and operation of any type of building. The assessment of human thermal perception through rating scales, for example in post-occupancy studies, has been applied for several decades; however, long-existing assumptions related to these rating scales had been questioned by several researchers. The aim of this study was to gain deeper knowledge on contextual influences on the interpretation of thermal perception scales and their verbal anchors by survey participants. A questionnaire was designed and consequently applied in 21 language versions. These surveys were conducted in 57 cities in 30 countries resulting in a …

36. An approach to calculate the equivalent solar heat gain coefficient of glass windows with fixed and dynamic shading in tropical climates - 2019
In tropical climates, glass windows are important for a building's energy efficiency. By providing shading on a glass window, direct solar incident radiation can be restricted. This lowers the cooling energy consumption in buildings. The most commonly used method to provide shading is by using fixed shades such as overhangs and fins. Another method is to provide dynamic shades that can be controlled based on incident solar radiation on the façade. Shading is a method to control the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and visible light transmission (VLT) of a vertical fenestration. This study is performed to obtain the equivalent SHGC of vertical fenestration with fixed and dynamic shading. Prescriptive requirements of energy codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1 and ECBC-India, limit the maximum SHGC value of fenestration. The effective SHGC with fixed shading is defined as the equivalent SHGC. The energy codes …

37. Development of a surrogate model by extracting top characteristic feature vectors for building energy prediction - 2019
In early stage of building design, design team has to consider and simulate energy consumption for several combinations of various input parameters to analyze the building energy consumption. In a scenario considering five parameters, each with ten variations, one has to simulate hundred thousand combinations. It requires a lot of computation to simulate energy consumption for all the input combinations. This paper aims at reducing the computation required to compute the energy consumption of all the combinations. This is done by identifying appropriate training samples, computing their energy consumption using EnergyPlus and estimating energy consumption of the rest of the data using machine learning techniques. This paper presents two sampling methods along with various regression techniques to predict energy consumption of a building in the early phase. It involves usage of efficient sampling …

38. Climate zone classification of India using new base temperature - 2019
The development of building codes for energy efficiency depends on climate zones. National Building Codes of India prescribes five climate zones in India. This classification does not consider fluctuations of outdoor conditions and its effect on indoor comfort conditions. The indoor comfort conditions can be incorporated by using Heating Degree Day (HDD) and Cooling Degree Day (CDD) analysis. Additionally, this classification used mean monthly temperature which cannot capture extreme conditions of the month while the degree day can account for fluctuations in the outdoor temperature and eliminate those periods when heating or cooling systems do not need to operate for a day.

39. Explainable Clustering Using Hyper-Rectangles for Building Energy Simulation Data - 2019
Clustering has become a very popular machine learning technique for identifying groups of data points with common features in a set of data points. In several applications, there is a need to explain the clusters so that the user can understand the underlying commonalities. One such application is in the area of building energy simulation. There is a need to cluster solutions obtained by parametric energy simulation runs and explain the characteristics of each cluster for human consumption. This paper demonstrates how the axis-aligned hyper-rectangles based clustering, on building energy simulation data, can help identify clusters and describe the governing rules for each cluster. We are calling these rules design strategies. Instead of the distance-based clustering methods that are unable to extract simple rules from the underlying commonalities in each cluster, this method is able to overcome this limitation. This …

41. Circadian lighting in a space daylit by a tubular daylight device - 2019
This study demonstrates an experimental example of application of time-lapse high dynamic range images for analyzing variations in correlated color temperature (CCT) and circadian lighting in an interior space daylit using a tubular daylight device (TDD). Previous studies have shown that the spectral composition of daylight affects human circadian rhythms, with emphasis on wavelengths towards the blue region of the visible spectrum. Spectrally based metrics such as CCT can therefore aid in evaluating the circadian impact of daylight. TDDs redirect daylight towards interior spaces with changing light levels and color temperatures during the daylight hours. This paper details the color temperature and circadian lighting metrics (circadian luminance and illuminance) in an interior space throughout a period of several days in a mid-latitude, temperate, sunny climate. An automated time-lapse HDR photography …

43. Impact of thermally activated furniture system on the occupant thermal comfort–A study using thermoregulation model and computational fluid dynamics. - 2019
Air-conditioned buildings are conventionally designed and operated to maintain homogeneous thermal conditions. Maintaining the occupied and unoccupied zones at the same thermal conditions leads to higher energy consumption. More importantly, homogeneous thermal conditions do not address the need for individual thermal comfort preferences. A personal comfort system (PCS) allows the occupants to create desired localized thermal conditions around workstations in the office environment. Using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and multi-node thermoregulation models, this paper evaluates the feasibility of a PCS with a radiantly cooled partition panel system to achieve thermal comfort. All input parameters for the model were derived from reallife measurements, including thermal characteristics of the room, work desk with radiantly cooled partition, and HVAC systems. A combination of scSTREAM™ and scTETRA™ was used to model the room and the human body (Cradle MSC Software, 2017). The simulation model had a mannequin in a seated position having summer clothing values and office activity metabolic rate. Combinations of three ambient room air temperatures and five panel surface temperatures were investigated to estimate the impact of radiant panels on overall thermal comfort and various body parts of the mannequin. The body parts like the thighs, chest, back, and pelvis showed a low thermal variation in the range of 0.9-1.2 C. The parts such as the head, neck, shoulders, arms, and legs showed a thermal variation in the range of 1.6-2.7 C, while the body parts farthest from the warm torso-the feet, experienced the …

For this, it is essential to make reliable forecasting of consumption profile in real-time which is very challenging and still emerging. In this study, we focus on forecasting HVAC cooling energy consumption at sub-hourly forecasting horizon which enables us to analyze and control the demand in real-time. With the aid of energy meters and adaptation of BACnet technology in the target building, we collected real building cooling energy consumption data and HVAC systems usage at a higher resolution. In this methodology, weather data from Weather Underground of Gachibowli, Hyderabad location has been used. These recorded weather parameters are being used as explanatory variables. Along with the weather parameters, many other feature-engineered explanatory variables which are discussed in the paper has been …

48. Predicting Impact of Cooling Set-Point Change on Demand Reduction in Real-time - 2019
Based on recent strategies in peak demand reduction for HVAC systems, simple measures like increasing cooling set-point temperatures serves as an effective Demand Response (DR). Majority of the past studies in demand response focus majorly on developing strategies that reduce peak demand and on demand side energy management to optimize energy consumption with the help of renewable energy resources. Research in estimating the potential of DR programs is required and is gaining momentum. It is essential to develop reliable estimation models that can be applied in real-time. We therefore focus on developing a model that predicts the impact of change in HVAC set-point temperature on cooling energy demand. During model evaluation, we made an observation that after a DR event when the set-points are back to normal schedule, sudden and rapid peaks occur in the demand while it is ramping up …

52. Machine Learning-Based Occupancy Estimation Using Multivariate Sensor Nodes - 2018
In buildings, a large chunk of energy is spent on heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. One way to optimize their usage is to make them demand-driven depending on human occupancy. This paper focuses on accurately estimating the number of occupants in a room by leveraging multiple heterogeneous sensor nodes and machine learning models. For this purpose, low-cost and non-intrusive sensors such as CO 2 , temperature, illumination, sound and motion were used. The sensor nodes were deployed in a room in a star configuration and measurements were recorded for a period of four days. A regression based method is proposed for calculating the slope of CO 2 , a new feature derived from real-time CO 2  values. Supervised learning algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were used on …

53. Development of a method for selection of representative city in a climate zone - 2018
A building is a boundary between an outdoor climate and indoor conditions. The building energy consumption, notably the energy used for airconditioning is closely related to outdoor climate. The Solar Radiation, Drybulb Temperature and Relative Humidity are the important climatic parameters which affect building's thermal and visual conditions. The energy codes development analyses and evaluation of new technologies with respect to energy savings and financial viability have been carried out for selected cities that are supposed to represent any particular climate zone. There is a significant change in thermal loads in different cities of a climate zone.

56. Plug Load Identification using Regression based Nearest Neighbor Classifier - 2017
Energy utilization can be improved by precise plug load monitoring and control. Plug load energy consumption is nearly 30% of the total building energy consumption. Therefore, plug load identification is a key requirement for energy conservation in buildings. Intrusive load monitoring techniques identify loads precisely but have not been tested widely so far for their performance in changing operating conditions. Hence, the present research proposes a robust low frequency intrusive load monitoring technique to identify load accurately. A smart power strip using proposed load identification technique is designed and developed. Linear regression is applied on the acquired data to capture the behavioral trends of a particular device more explicitly and concisely. Further, weighted K-NN classifier is applied on the transformed data set for device. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better …

57. Performance Evaluation of Personalized Radiant Conditioning System for Cooling Mode - 2017
The radiant systems consume less energy and provide better thermal comfort as compared to the Conventional system, but the main drawback of this technology is condensation and inability to cater the latent load. These challenges have directed many researchers to move their emphasis towards Personalized Conditioning System which aims to generate a microclimate zone near the vicinity of occupant according to need. This study is focused on Personalized Conditioning System when it is combined with a radiant system. The objectives of this study are 1) Evaluate the performance analysis of the system in cooling mode and, 2) Evaluate the performance of PRCS for cooling mode on different radiant cooling systems. An experimental setup of an office cubicle has been designed and fabricated using radiant panels at MNIT Jaipur, India. Three cases of the experiment were designed to evaluate and compare the performance of the system which are: Only Radiant Cooled Ceiling System (RCCS), Only Personalized Radiant Cooling System (PRCS), and both PRCS and RCCS coupled. It was observed that PRCS alone is sufficient to reach the thermal comfort criteria with low energy consumption, but it was unable to maintain the background temperature. When PRCS coupled with RCCS, it gives maximum thermal comfort for high supply water temperature ranging from 17 C to 21 C.

58. Cool roof implications on thermal adaptation in built environment - 2017
Albedo roof reduces heat gain into the built space, mainly due to high solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Few studies have been conducted in tropical climates to evaluate the effect of albedo roof on thermal adaptation in naturally conditioned (NV) and air-conditioned (AC) buildings. Therefore, present study intends to analyse the effect of cool roof on reduction in discomfort hours in NV and improvement in energy efficiency in conditioned environment.

This paper demonstrates the application of Autotune, a methodology aimed at automatically producing calibrated building energy models using measured data, in two case studies. In the first case, a building model is de-tuned by deliberately injecting faults into more than 60 parameters. This model was then calibrated using Autotune and its accuracy with respect to the original model was evaluated in terms of the industry-standard normalized mean bias error and coefficient of variation of root mean squared error metrics set forth in ASHRAE Guideline 14. In addition to whole-building energy consumption, outputs including lighting, plug load profiles, HVAC energy consumption, zone temperatures, and other variables were analyzed. In the second case, Autotune calibration is compared directly to experts’ manual calibration of an emulated-occupancy, full-size residential building with comparable calibration results in …

61. Assessment of the impact of cool roofs in rural buildings in India - 2016
Increasing roof reflectance reduces absorption of solar radiation, roof surface temperature and heat ingress into the building. This leads to an increase in indoor comfort and reduction in room air temperature that in turn results in energy saving by reducing AC demand. To assess this impact of cool roofs on buildings in rural and peri-urban areas of India, a study was performed on two un-conditioned school buildings in Hyderabad (ZPH School) and Nagpur (VNHM School). Two classrooms of same size, function, and occupancy from both the school buildings were monitored for a period of ten weeks starting from March 2014 till May 2014. The data from the experiments and their analyses showed promising results. The average reduction and peak reduction in indoor air, roof underdeck and roof overdeck surface temperatures are 2.1 °C, 5.0 °C and 12.3 °C and 4.3 °C, 10.0 °C and 26.3 °C respectively for the room …

62. Development for cool roof calculator for India - 2016
In tropical countries such as India, increasing the roof albedo helps to reduce the heat ingress through the roof. This further reduces air-conditioning energy consumption in conditioned buildings and increases comfort in unconditioned buildings. In order to help users determine the benefits of high albedo roofs under varying conditions, a simple calculator has been developed. Parameters such as location, building type, roof area, and surface properties of the roof are taken as inputs. Annual EnergyPlus simulations are performed for the given parameters and the results are displayed in both graphical and tabular formats. It also calculates the simple payback by comparing a given base case roof albedo with the proposed roof albedo.

64. Office-like Test Chambers to Measure Cool Roof Energy Savings in Four Indian Climates - 2016
Selecting a high albedo (solar reflectance) waterproofing layer on the top of a roof helps lower the roof’s surface temperature and reduce the air conditioning energy consumption in the top floor of a building. The annual energy savings depend on factors including weather, internal loads, and building operation schedule. To demonstrate the energy saving potential of high albedo roofs, an apparatus consisting of two nearly identical test chambers (A and B) has been built in four Indian climates: Chennai (hot & humid), Bangalore (temperate), Jhagadia (Hot & dry) and Delhi (composite). Each chamber has well-insulated walls to mimic the core of an office building. Both chambers have the same construction, equipment, and operating schedule, differing only in roof surface. The reinforced cement concrete roof of Chamber A is surfaced with a low-albedo cement layer, while that of Chamber B is surfaced with a high-albedo water proof membrane (change in solar reflectance of 0.28). The experiment will be carried out for one year to explore seasonal variations in energy savings. Initial results in the month of July (post summer) shows that savings from high albedo roof ranges from 0.04 kWh/m2/day in temperate climates, to 0.08 kWh/m2/day in hot & dry climate.

65. Optimizing roof insulation for roofs with high albedo coating and radiant barriers in India - 2015
To make roofs energy efficient, typically two types of techniques are followed: surface treatments (cool roofs, radiant barriers) and thermal property modifications (roof insulation). The interplay between these two techniques has been studied using energy simulations. A single storey, daytime operational, office building of 200 m2 area has been simulated for five climatic zones in India. A total of 88 different roof combinations have been studied for each climatic zone. An economic analysis using Internal Rate of Return has been performed to identify a suitable roof insulation thickness for a roof with high albedo, and radiant barrier combination. The incremental benefits in energy savings reduces by adding insulation after a limit. For a roof with albedo of 0.6 and radiant barrier emittance of 0.2, the optimized roof R-value is 0.49 m2 K/W in hot and dry and composite climates, 0.31 m2 K/W in warm and humid and …

66. Plug load identification in educational buildings using machine learning algorithms - 2015
Plug loads accounts for 20% to 30% of building energy consumption and has an increasing trend. Automatic plug load identification is one of the technique for effectively managing the plug load consumption. There are several studies on Non Intrusive load monitoring (NILM) but limited studies on Intrusive load monitoring (ILM). ILM is a technique that uses a low end power meter on every plug load to monitor it’s power consumption. In this paper, machine-learning techniques are applied on low-frequency ILM data for identification of plug load and it’s state (ON/Sleep). The results show the identification accuracies are close to 98%.

71. Experimental determination of comfort benefits from cool-roof application to an un-conditioned building in India - 2014
Increasing roof reflectance helps in savings in air-conditioning energy consumption, increase in indoor comfort at the building level and mitigates Urban Heat Island effect, reduces net solar radiation absorbed by the earth, lowers local air temperature and pollutant formation, and reducing global warming at the macro level. Previous studies have demonstrated energy savings in buildings using cool roofs. However, not many have evaluated the indoor comfort benefits of cool roofs for unconditioned interior spaces, especially in India. Here, we describe a study of an un-conditioned, institutional building in a composite climate in India. Monitoring was performed for a period of six months (January to June 2012) on two adjacent sections of continuous concrete roof surface, one of which had been previously coated with a white paint coating. The measured shortwave band-averaged (0.3–3 µm) solar reflectance was 0.28 …

72. Development and analysis of a tool for speed up of EnergyPlus through parallelization - 2014
This paper describes how the EPparallel tool splits a single annual simulation into 12 simulations of one month each and runs them in parallel. The paper also describes the methodology to prepare input files, enable file sharing between nodes, collate results generated by the nodes, and ensure quality check on the simulations. The EPparallel tool uses Message Passing Interface library and runs on Linux. The tool has been tested on 16 commercial reference buildings over 16 US weather files. The results of these 256 runs which include the run times, computing time overheads, speed gains and accuracy of results are presented in this paper. The speed gain ranged from 2.9×to 7.8×and deviation (percentage of output values obtained in parallel simulation which were off by more than 1% as compared to output values obtained in annual simulation) ranged from 0% to 4%.

73. Plug loads: usage and energy consumption analysis - 2014
The electric load of an office building can be classified into lighting load, HVAC load, and plug load. Monitoring the lighting and HVAC load is relatively simple. However, the product range of plug load devices is diverse and their usages vary considerably making it difficult to understand plug load usage and consumption. Plug loads account for more than 20 percent of energy consumption in a building. Even though the share of plug load in building energy is increasing, very few studies exist on the device level energy usage and consumption in an academic institution in India. Therefore, the study of plug load is done to gain insight on their usage and energy consumption patterns. A total of 93 energy meters were installed on a sample of plug load devices. For each connected device, the current, voltage, and accumulated power are logged along with the timestamp for a period of 4 months. Different analysis like estimation of annual energy usage, average load profiles on different day types, variability in energy consumption among devices and so on were performed. Based on the analysis, the study recommends strategies to reduce plug load consumption and also suggests load schedules which can be used in energy simulation for realistic energy results.

74. WinOpt–An Early Stage Design Tool for Optimizing Window Parameters - 2014
In order to help architects and designers make early design decisions, an online tool (WinOpt) has been developed. WinOpt optimizes various components associated with the design of windows such as Azimuth Angle (angle with respect to North), Aspect Ratio, WWR (Window Wall Ratio), SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient) of glass used for windows, and various local shading strategies such as overhang and side fins. WinOpt performs annual energy simulations for a given location using EnergyPlus. It uses an optimization tool in the back end (GenOpt) to reduce the few million simulations to a few hundred, thus helping in making perfect rapid design decisions. WinOpt optimizes the design to minimize the operational energy for conditioned buildings and maximize thermal comfort for unconditioned buildings. It also has a parametric option where parametric simulations are performed for selected values for various input parameters. This can help the user understand the spectrum of design solutions. Since EnergyPlus can evaluate thermal comfort conditions besides energy consumption in a building, WinOpt can help in design decisions for low energy/net zero energy buildings.

82. STUDY OF THERMAL ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY SAVINGS CONSIDERING ADAPTIVE THERMOSTAT CONTROL: A CASE STUDY OF AN AIR CONDITIONED OFFICE BUILDING IN COMPOSITE CLIMATE OF INDIA - 2013
Thermal comfort in building results from a complex set of physical conditions, occupant sensations and preferences as well as occupants behaviour therefore thermally comfortable environment leads to better energy efficiency in buildings. A field study was carried out at five star rated (Certified by Bureau of Energy Efficiency, BEE) air conditioned office building (day time occupancy) located at Jaipur, composite climate of India. The purpose of conducting this study was to evaluate the existing thermal environmental conditions and then to propose the required thermal comfort conditions and determine energy saving potential considering adaptive thermostat control strategy. Questionnaire was developed for conducting the field survey including objective and subjective information as per class˗ II protocol of field measurements. Statistical analysis of occupant responses and recorded environmental variables was performed to determine the required comfortable temperature in the building and this temperature was used as thermostat set point of the air conditioner. The office building was modelled using eQUEST simulation program and calibrated with measured annual energy consumption. Result revealed that majority of the occupants felt thermally comfortable at proposed room temperature of 27.5oC as against the existing practice of maintaining 20-22oC at which most of the occuapants were complaining overcooling and discomfort. Proposed set point temperature of air conditioner also resulted in building energy saving of about 7.86%.

84. Quantifying the direct benefits of cool roofs in an urban setting: Reduced cooling energy use and lowered greenhouse gas emissions - 2012
Cool roofs, cool pavements, and urban vegetation reduce cooling energy use in buildings, lower local air pollution, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from urban areas. To promote widespread and large-scale implementation of cool roofs to moderate urban heat-island phenomenon, more awareness and understanding of cool roof benefits at the local level is needed. As part of an investigation of strategies to mitigate urban heat-island effects, field data gathered from a monitoring project on cool roofs in India were reviewed. An innovative field-based analytical method was developed to quantify cooling energy savings resulting from the installation of cool roofs on commercial buildings. For buildings monitored in the Metropolitan Hyderabad region, the measured annual energy savings from roof-whitening of previously black roofs ranged from 20 to 22 kWh/m2 of roof area, corresponding to a cooling …

We evaluate differences in clear-sky upwelling shortwave radiation reaching the top of the atmosphere in response to increasing the albedo of roof surfaces in an area of India with moderately high aerosol loading. Treated (painted white) and untreated (unpainted) roofs on two buildings in northeast India were analyzed on five cloudless days using radiometric imagery from the IKONOS satellite. Comparison of a radiative transfer model (RRTMG) and radiometric satellite observations shows good agreement (R 2= 0.927). Results show a mean increase of∼ 50 W m− 2 outgoing at the top of the atmosphere for each 0.1 increase of the albedo at the time of the observations and a strong dependence on atmospheric transmissivity.

87. Calibrated simulation for estimating energy savings by the use of cool roof in five Indian climatic zones - 2011
A calibrated model has been used to estimate the energy savings by cool roof application on buildings located in five different climatic zones. The model has been calibrated as per the measured data in a building located in Hyderabad (India), and the same has been used to project energy savings in different cities located in five different climatic zones of the country. Results show that the maximum reduction in energy consumption is observed in Mumbai (warm and humid climate), followed by Ahmedabad (hot and dry climate), Bangalore (temperate climate), and Delhi (composite climate). Least energy saving is observed in Shillong (cold climate). In all the climates except cold, the financial payback period is acceptable, being less than 3 yr, whereas for cold climate, the investment is getting paid back in 6.69 yr, making the cool roof application not very attractive.

90. Using Cool Roofs to Reduce Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Urban Heat-island Effects: Findings from an India Experiment - 2011
Cool roofs, cool pavements, and urban vegetation reduce energy use in buildings, lower local air pollutant concentrations, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from urban areas. This report summarizes the results of a detailed monitoring project in India and related simulations of meteorology and air quality in three developing countries. The field results quantified direct energy savings from installation of cool roofs on individual commercial buildings. The measured annual energy savings potential from roof-whitening of previously black roofs ranged from 20-22 kWh/m2 of roof area, corresponding to an air-conditioning energy use reduction of 14-26% in commercial buildings. The study estimated that typical annual savings of 13-14 kWh/m2 of roof area could be achieved by applying white coating to uncoated concrete roofs on commercial buildings in the Metropolitan Hyderabad region, corresponding to cooling energy savings of 10-19%. With the assumption of an annual increase of 100,000 square meters of new roof construction for the next 10 years in the Metropolitan Hyderabad region, the annual cooling energy savings due to whitening concrete roof would be 13-14 GWh of electricity in year ten alone, with cumulative 10-year cooling energy savings of 73-79 GWh for the region. The estimated savings for the entire country would be at least 10 times the savings in Hyderabad, i.e., more than 730-790 GWh. We estimated that annual direct CO2 reduction associated with reduced energy use would be 11-12 kg CO2/m2 of flat concrete roof area whitened, and the cumulative 10-year CO2 reduction would be approximately 0.60-0.65 million …

91. Development and performance evaluation of a methodology, based on distributed computing, for speeding EnergyPlus simulation - 2011
This article presents an approach for speeding EnergyPlus simulations. The computing run time of an energy simulation depends on several variables and is directly proportional to the simulation RunPeriod. In the proposed approach, data parallelization is achieved by breaking an annual simulation into several segments of smaller RunPeriod, each handled by a separate computer/processor. The speed gain achieved by running 12 one-month RunPeriod segments in parallel as compared to single simulation of 12 months is between three and six times. Segmentation of simulation has resulted in minor deviations between the results obtained through segmented simulations and annual simulations. Methods for reducing these deviations on annual and monthly basis are presented in this article using 12 benchmark models each simulated for five cities. On annual basis, a maximum deviation of 0.06% was observed …

The study, conducted in composite climate of India, exhibits improvement in energy efficiency of a conditioned building block with the use of energy conservation measures (ECMs) recommended by National Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC). In first part of it, subject building model was individually applied with five ECMs and two combinations of these ECMs by using constant thermostat settings. Similarly in second part of the study the same was done with adaptive thermostat settings. Sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of ECMs get reduced with increase in building footprint and internal loads. Analysis of thermal comfort in an unconditioned building using same set of ECMs was also carried out to see improvement in comfort hours.

93. Energyplus simulation speedup using data parallelization concept - 2010
EnergyPlus is an energy simulation tool which models heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and other energy flows in buildings. It is based on the popular features of BLAST and DOE-2. Though EnergyPlus is more advanced than DOE-2, it comes with a drawback of larger simulation runtime. A decrease in the simulation runtime of EnergyPlus would increase the usability of the software. In this paper, a concept has been proposed which uses data parallelization to speed up EnergyPlus simulation. Data parallelization is a form of parallelization for computing across multiple processors or multiple computers in a cluster, run under a suitable environment. Data parallelism focuses on distributing the data across different parallel computing nodes by breaking it into smaller chunks, each of which is processed on by the same function, running in parallel on different cores/machines. In the proposed concept, this is …

94. Smeo: A platform for smart classrooms with enhanced information access and operations automation - 2010
This paper explores the area of creating smart spaces using mobile Internet devices to develop intelligent classrooms. We propose a suite of applications that leverage the recent progress made in the domains of mobile computers and information access, resulting in a richer classroom experience where knowledge is dispensed with greater efficiency while also making it possible to access it efficiently from the Internet as well as peers. We attempt to achieve this by introducing novel means of classroom teaching and management and an intelligent information access system while harnessing the computational capabilities of mobile Internet devices. Though the current work is still in progress, this paper elaborates on our attempts in reducing the gap between technological progress in various domains and the existing pedagogy.

95. Determination of Energy Saving of Cool Roof on an Office Building in Hyderabad , India Using Calibrated Simulation - 2010
The method of calibrated simulation has been used to estimate the energy savings by application of cool roof for the building of Satyam Learning Centre (SLC) at Hyderabad (India). Energy simulation model of the building was created using ‘DesignBuilder v. 1.95’and the building was monitored for few months. Mismatch between the simulation results and actual energy consumption has been reduced to obtain the calibrated model of the building using the method suggested in IPMVP Option-D. The calibrated model is then used to predict energy saving from the cool roof; the annual cooling energy savings were 19.4 kWh/m2. This saving corresponds to 9% reduction in annual air conditioning load and 5% reduction in overall annual energy consumption. Cost/benefit analysis for cool roof at SLC showed a 2.4 year financial payback period.

96. Energy Conservation Building Code in India: Status, Issues and Opportunities - 2010
The Energy Conservation Act 2001 was the first major initiative in India to channelize and catalyze energy efficiency improvement in various sectors of economy. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency was set up per the provision of this act, which in 2007 brought out Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) with an overall purpose of providing minimum requirements for the energy efficient design and construction of buildings. ECBC covers building envelope, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, interior and exterior lighting system, service hot water, electrical power and motors. Since the launch of this code in May 2007, efforts are being made to promote and facilitate the adoption of this code through several training and capacity building programs. A program committee has been set to take care of the comments from stakeholders and inconsistencies, due to which revision of the code was brought out in …

97. Online Energy Savings Calculator for Cool Roof - 2010
Cool roof is one of the important strategies of energy savings in the tropical climate especially for low rise buildings. Standardization of the possible energy savings for a measure like cool roof would be quite difficult due to availability of various technologies and materials, as well as due to difference in building forms and climatic conditions. This paper talks about the development of an online tool for estimating energy saving through cool roof strategy using Energy Plus v4 as the backend simulation engine. Energy savings are calculated through simulating two identical buildings with different roof reflectivity values. Using this tool, simulations are run for the base case roof reflectivity of 0.3 and proposed case roof reflectivity of 0.75 for various major cities in India for a single floor, daytime use building. An average saving of 6.2% in cooling energy and 2.4% in total energy consumption was obtained using this tool.

104. Smart occupancy sensors to reduce energy consumption - 2000
Occupancy sensors have long been used for control of various devices (like artificial light, HVAC devices, etc.). Past research has shown that use of occupancy sensors for control of lighting can save up to 30% electrical energy used for lighting. However, most of the sensors, which are currently being put to use, have a preset (sometimes user adjustable) time delay (TD) (the time after which the lights or any other load will be switched “off” after the last motion is detected by the sensor). If this TD is long then, it will have less energy savings, as the load will remain “on” during unoccupied period also. At the same time, if the TD is kept short then it may result in unwanted switching “off” (False Off) of the lights when no motion is detected during periods of occupancy. It has been observed in our research that the activity level of a user changes over the time of the day. Also, it is seen that activity level of different users is …
