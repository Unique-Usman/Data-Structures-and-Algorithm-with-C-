This repository contains my implementation of linked list using C++ Object.

wk9_list.C -> This link contains the implement of linked using C++ Object just in a file and the linked list is not generic. It contains different methods like addNodeEnd, removeNode, addNodeBegin, AddNodeAfter, countNode, printNode etc.

template directory contains a the same implementation of linked as above but it is generic and I implement multiple file for different files used in the linkedlist
